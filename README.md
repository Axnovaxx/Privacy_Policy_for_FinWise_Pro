At **FinWise Pro**, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of user privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how our mobile application handles data to ensure a secure and private experience.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
**FinWise Pro** is designed to function without collecting any user data.

* **No Personal Information:** We do not require or collect personal details such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.
* **No Financial Data Transmission:** All financial inputs, calculations, and loan quotes are processed exclusively on your device. We do not transmit or store your financial information on any external servers.

## 2. Local Data Storage
To provide features like history tracking and saved quotes, the Application uses a local **Room Database**.

* **Storage Location:** All data is stored within the Application's private storage directory on your mobile device.
* **User Control:** You have full control over this data. You can delete all saved records at any time by clearing the app data in your device settings or by uninstalling the application.

## 3. Permissions
The Application requests minimal permissions to function:

* **Storage Permission:** This is requested only when you use the "Export to PDF" feature. This allows the app to save the generated report to your device's storage.
* **Network Access:** While the core features are designed for offline use, basic network access might be used only for system-level updates or responding to user-initiated support requests.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We prioritize a clean, tracking-free experience:

* **No Analytics:** We do not use third-party tools like Google Analytics or Firebase to track user behavior.
* **No Advertising:** This application does not include advertising SDKs that collect data for profiling or targeting.
